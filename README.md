# HubServ
Client-server information storage for Student Hub clients. The Student Hub being a place where Georgia Piedmont Technical College students, staff and faculty can bring personal devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones, etc.) to have them serviced/troubleshooted.

This program was part of an effort to create a homegrown program to electronically store Student Hub documentation. Due to a decision by higher-ups to discontinue use of homegrown programs, the program was never completed and an alternative system was implemented.
